## An Incomplete Guide to Inclusive Language for Startups and Tech

> Language is one of the most powerful tools we have as humans. It binds us. Instructs us. When used well, it creates a common understanding.
>
> And itâ€™s essential for creating an environment where everyone feels welcome and included.
>
> Historically, language has left many out. Individuals and groups have been marginalized and discriminated against because of their culture, race and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, socioeconomic status, appearance and more.
>
> We can do better. Inclusive language seeks to treat all people with respect, dignity, and impartiality. It is constructed to bring everyone into the group and exclude no one.
