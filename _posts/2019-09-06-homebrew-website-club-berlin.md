>
> Join a gathering of like-minded people and get friendly support with writing, creating, and anything to do with using and improving your own website!

In collaboration with a few other web afficionados, I will try to restart [Homebrew Website Club](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club) in Berlin.

### What to expect?

We will probably try to follow [the suggested structure](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club#Structure), as much as organising and limitations of the venue allows for.

Since this will be the first event in a few years, and with new organisers, expect for it to take a few events for us to find the format that works in this group.

### Who is it for?

Everyone!
