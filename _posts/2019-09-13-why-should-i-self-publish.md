## Why should I self-publish on the web?

Here's yet another example of what can happen, when you give control over your content to 3rd parties.

They put up a pay wall (or the equivalent thereof, you pay with your identity):

Medium has decided that their commercial goals are more important than the author's need to have their audience able to read their content.

This is far from a unique case, nor one that is specific to Medium. But, it beautifully illustrates why we need to be in control of our own content on the web.

If you're in Berlin and interested in self-publishing on the web, then join us at [Homebrew Website Club]({% post_url 2019-09-06-homebrew-website-club-berlin %}).

If you're not in Berlin, then perhaps one of the other [Homebrew Website Club chapters](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club) could work for you, or you could start one in your area or create a virtual chapter.
