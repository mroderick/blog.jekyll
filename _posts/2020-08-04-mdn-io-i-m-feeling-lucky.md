# mdn.io, I'm feeling lucky

I often need to look up details in the [Mozilla Developer Network documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) (MDN). It's a great resource, that keeps getting better every year.

A few years ago, I learned that a lovely people have set up a very convenient "url shortener" / "search service" to do an "I'm feeling lucky" search on the MDN documentation.

In your browser's URL bar, type `mdn.io/â€°s`, where `%s` is your search string. Hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> and arrive at the best matching page on MDN.

Example:

`mdn.io/function.apply` takes you to `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply`

I use this as my primary way of navigating MDN.

You can [read the source of mdn.io on GitHub](https://github.com/lazd/mdn.io).
