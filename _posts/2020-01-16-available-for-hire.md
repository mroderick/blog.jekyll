# Available for hire!

Full-stack software engineer with a bent towards web standards, quality and longevity of applications available for hire.

I have worked professionally as a software engineer since the late 90s. I've seen a good breadth and depth of applications over the years, having worked on green field, established and legacy applications.

I enjoy improving existing applications as much as working on green field applications.

## Happiness looks like

### Organisation

* [People][p1] [first][p2] [organisations][p3]
* Diversity and inclusion
* Effective, open, bi-directional communication ([NVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication))

### Product / project

* [Users][uf1] [first][uf2] [thinking][uf3]
* [User Story Mapping][usm]
* [NoEstimates][ne], [forecasting][fc]
* Open minded pragmatism

### Technology

* [Lean Web](https://leanweb.dev)
* [Progressive Enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement)
* [Web standards][web-standards]
* [ECMA-262][ecma-262]
* [Accessiblity (WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
* [System fonts][sys-font]

## What I am hoping to find in my next role

I am hoping to find a diverse team in a diverse organisation (or one that is trending that way). I regularly contribute to open source and hope to continue that work in my next role, perhaps in combination with mentoring of other engineeers.

## Ambitions

My personal ambitions are not tied to specific outcomes, but to keep moving in a positive direction. To keep learning and growing.

Having said that, I am looking for opportunities that will allow me to pursue a role as Principal Engineer or Head of Engineering.

## Interested?
