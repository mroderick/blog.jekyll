> Stop interviewing, stop organising the off-sites, stop onboarding, stop fielding requests from users, stop anything that sounds like team building. Stop helping other people with their work. Archive mail. Quit slack channels. Do not curate the team roadmap.

>
> Stop being the unofficial lead. (If you're in the same situation and you're the official lead, consider stopping that too!)
