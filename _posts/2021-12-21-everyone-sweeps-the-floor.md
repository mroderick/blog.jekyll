## Everyone sweeps the floor

The rule "Everyone sweeps the floor" always resonated with me.

This was very much the behaviour and expectations of the person that ran the unit that I worked in some years ago at Apple.

At the time, I was unaware that the badge sticker existed. My boss did mention that they appreciated me always "sweeping the floor" ... both in the codebases I worked in, but also emptying the dishwasher.
