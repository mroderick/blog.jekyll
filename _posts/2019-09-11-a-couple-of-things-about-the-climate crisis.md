## A couple of things about the climate crisis

It seems the world is finally waking up to the fact that we have a climate crisis.

We owe a great thanks to [Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg) and all the children and young adults that are striking to keep society and governments aware of the crisis.

### What can we do?

I don't think of myself as a great world citizen and am trying to do better. Here are a couple of things that I think are worth doing in pursuit of that goal.

#### Join the Global Climate Strike

On September 20th and 27th there will be [global climate strikes](https://globalclimatestrike.net), where they're encouraging everyone to attend.

You'll find me at Brandenburger Tor in Berlin, Germany.

#### Offset your emissions

I am using [atmosfair](https://www.atmosfair.de/en/) to offset the emissions from my flights. I've offset all my flights from 2018 onwards, and will continue to do so until it is no longer needed (or I stop flying).

If you can afford to fly, you can afford to offset your emissions.
