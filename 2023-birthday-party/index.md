## 2023 Birthday Party - DETAILS!

Uyanga (Uya) and I will be celebrating our combined 90 years on this planet by having a birthday party on Saturday, 2023-06-24 in the afternoon. And if you add Richard into the mix, we are a combined 108 years this year - a truly auspicious number.

## Where and when

![Fräulein Kimchi](./fraulein-kimchi.jpg)

The party will be in the premises of the newly opened [Fraeulein Kimchi Restaurant in Berlin Weissensee, Gürtelstraße 10, 13088 Berlin](https://goo.gl/maps/jRiNdosn4nrSpzi37) and will be fairly casual.



We start at 12 noon and will go until ~5.30 pm. You can come by whenever you like and don't need to stay for the whole day.

Afterwards, the regular restaurant dinner service will commence, so you can stay on if you wish.

## Who
Please RSVP with an indication of how many of your party will be coming, plus ones, little ones and furry ones are of course welcome! There is [a playground nearby](https://goo.gl/maps/jRiNdosn4nrSpzi37) and green areas around, where you can take a breather, walk your dog, etc.

## Food and drink
There will be some food (mostly of the Korean variety) … think mingling with a plate of delicious bits, not sitting down for a three course meal. There will be some drinks of what people like drinking on a Saturday afternoon in summer.
If you have specific dietary requirements or allergies that make eating from a buffet difficult please contact us beforehand.

## Gifts

Please don’t get us any presents, we have more than enough earthly belongings. Instead, a small donation towards paying for the party would be very welcome.

Please send donations to [Morgan's PayPal](https://paypal.me/MorganRoderick).

Alternatively, you are very welcome to donate to Uya’s preferred charity, the [Müttergenesungswerk](https://www.muettergenesungswerk.de/spenden-engagieren/kraftspenderin-gesucht/jetzt-spenden?gemeinsamstark-in-der-krise/spende).
