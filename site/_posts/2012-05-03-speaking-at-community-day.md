# Speaking at Community Day 2012

A while a ago I was approached by [@dalager](http://twitter.com/#!/dalager), who asked if I would be interested in giving my introductory talk about "[Closures, this, call and apply](http://communityday2012.c1preprod01.composite.net/Program/Javascript-Closures)" to a local audience at [Community Day](http://communityday2012.c1preprod01.composite.net/Program).

I am pretty much always excited about the opportunity to exchange knowledge and ideas with my tribe. So, after figuring out that I would in fact be in the area at the time of the conference, I jumped at the opportunity. With the current schedule, I'll be speaking in the afternoon... immediately after lunch.

If you're attending Community Day, you should check out the [schedule](http://communityday2012.c1preprod01.composite.net/Program), there are a lot of interesting talks packed into just one day. Firguring out what talks to attend is going to be difficult.

Personally, I am looking forward to the [Deconstructing Agile](http://communityday2012.c1preprod01.composite.net/Program/Deconstructing-Agile) and [Kiss my sASS](http://communityday2012.c1preprod01.composite.net/Program/Kiss-My-sASS) talks.

I'll post the slides here after the talk.

See you there!
