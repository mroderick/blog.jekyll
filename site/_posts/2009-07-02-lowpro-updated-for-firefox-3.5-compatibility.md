Firefox 3.5 was recently released, and offers significant updates. If you have not upgraded yet, you should [do so now](http://mozilla.org/firefox).

In the [LowPro community](http://groups.google.com/group/low-pro), we have been tracking compatibility with the upcoming Firefox. The existing LowPro was compatible with Firefox 3.5RC2, but incompatible with the final release of Firefox 3.5.

So, if you are using LowPro, _you should upgrade with a new version of LowPro today_.

You can either go for [Dan Webb's original version](http://github.com/danwrong/low-pro) or try out [my minification-friendly fork](http://github.com/mroderick/lowpro) (there is a minified version in dist).
