## Summary

I am a senior software engineer with a couple of decades of professional experience. My primary focus is on building high quality software products with long life span and low effort maintenance.

I am a [lean web](https://leanweb.dev) enthusiast, which means I subscribe to the idea that we can make a simpler, faster web by using the evolving web standards and browsers to their fullest. I master [HTTP][http], [JavaScript][js], [HTML][html] and [CSS][css].

I have extensive experience with building and maintaining [Single Page Applications][spa], highly resilient web applications using [progressive enhancement][pr-enh] as well as high quality JavaScript libraries. I am equally comfortable working both client- and server-side.

Over the time of my career I've naturally spent time with many different programming languages, libraries and frameworks, servers, etc. Please ask for specifics.

Code craftsmanship and developing good practices excites me a lot more than this season's new, shiny framework, build tool, etc. I think that great results can be achieved by applying good practices with carefully chosen tools.

I am always looking to develop lasting skillsets that focus on good practices, rather than fads and tools that happen to be fashionable this year. These books have been influential to me. You will often hear me recommend them to other developers:

* [Clean Code][cleancode]
* [Eloquent JavaScript][eloquent-js]
* [Refactoring][refactoring]
* [Release It!][release-it]
* [Working Effectively with Legacy Code][legacycode]

As a natural part of my work, I help other developers hone their skills, especially around refactoring and unit testing. I am a [core member of the Sinon.JS project][sinon].

Outside of my work life, I am passionate about cooking and photography, as well as participating in community work.
