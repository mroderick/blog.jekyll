## About the author

My name is Morgan Roderick, I write this blog.

As you might have guessed from reading some of the posts on the blog, I am a web developer, specialising in front end web development. I’ve been building just about every type of website professionally since 1998.

I believe I wrote my first webpage in 1994, the same year I got my first e-mail address. The webpage displayed photos taken by the Hubble telescope, and as far as I know, that page was only ever viewed in [Mosaic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_browser) on [SGI Indy machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_Indy).
